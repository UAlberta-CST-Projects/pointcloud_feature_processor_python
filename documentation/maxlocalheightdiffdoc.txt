DOCUMENTATION FOR compute_max_local_height_difference() IN operations.py

As in CloudCompare, the max height difference of a point is the maximum difference in height between a point and the
surrounding points. The function compute_max_local_height_difference() will compute this difference in the
z-direction of the point. 

To run this function, run the program compute_features.py. Open a point cloud file and then enter "3" into the
console when prompted to calculate the max height difference of the points in the point cloud.

compute_max_local_height_difference() computes the max z-direction difference of each point in a given 3D point
cloud. Its paramaters and return are as follows:

    :param pc: a dataframe containing the xyz portion of the pointcloud
    :param tree: a nearest neighbors tree for all the points
    :param PPEexec: a ProcessPoolExecutor for crunching all the numbers in parallel
    :param radius: the radius in which to search for nearest neighbors
    :param k: the max number of nearest neighbors to query
    :return: a list of height difference values with the same length as the number of points

This function first established a query tree for the nearest neighbours and determines arg lists (same as other
functions in the code), then computes the max height difference for each point using the helper function 
_compute_height	_diff().

_compute_height	_diff() is a helper function that computes the max height difference of a single point. It is built
to work with the map function. Its parameters and return are as follows:

    :param pts: a list of indices for points in the data matrix
    :return: the max height difference found in pts as a foot measurement

This function starts to find the max height difference of a point by finding the z-coordinate of each point in 'pts'
then finding the minimum and maximum values among these coordinates. The height difference is computed by the
following formula:

					height_diff = abs(max - min)

The height difference is then returned.
